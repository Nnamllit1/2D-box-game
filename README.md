# 2D and box game

A simple 2D sand box game (it at least wants to be a game) written in C++. It is a learning project for me to learn more about C++ and SDL2.

This "game" is inspired by [The Powder Toy](https://powdertoy.co.uk/) and [Sand:box](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2179380/Sandbox/).

## Requirements

- CMake
- SDL2

## Build

```bash
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build
```

## Run

```bash
build/game
```
